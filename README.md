# Go-http-web-server  
This is a basic videos application that gets the list of videos and updates the list of videos  
- This http web server has two endpoints  
  -one for returning the list of videos  
  -other for updating the list of videos  
This program will serve the video data on an http endpoint and also i'll write a seperate endpoint where i can update the list of videos and save it back to the file.
